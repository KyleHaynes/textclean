```{r, message=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(dplyr)
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/textshape", "trinker/lexicon", "trinker/textclean")
```

## Check Text

One of the most useful tools in **textclean** is `check_text` which scans text variables and reports potential problems.  Not all potential problems are definite problems for analysis but the report provides an overview of what may need further preparation.  The report also provides suggested functions for the reported problems.  The report provides information on the following:

1. **non_character** - Text that is `factor`.
1. **missing_ending_punctuation** - Text with no endmark at the end of the string.
1. **empty** - Text that contains an empty element (i.e., `""`).
1. **double_punctuation** - Text that contains two punctuation marks in the same string.
1. **non_space_after_comma** - Text that contains commas with no space after them.
1. **no_alpha** - Text that contains string elements with no alphabetic characters.
1. **non_ascii** - Text that contains non-ASCII characters.
1. **missing_value** - Text that contains missing values (i.e., `NA`).
1. **containing_escaped** - Text that contains escaped (see `?Quotes`).
1. **containing_digits** - Text that contains digits.
1. **containing_html** - Text that potentially contains HTML markup.
1. **indicating_incomplete** - Text that contains endmarks that are indicative of incomplete/trailing sentences (e.g., `...`).
1. **potentially_misspelled** - Text that contains potentially misspelled words.

Here is an example:

```{r}
x <- c("i like", "<p>i want. </p>. thet them ther .", "I am ! that|", "", NA, 
    "&quot;they&quot; they,were there", ".", "   ", "?", "3;", "I like goud eggs!", 
    "bi\xdfchen Z\xfcrcher", "i 4like...", "\\tgreat",  "She said \"yes\"")
Encoding(x) <- "latin1"
x <- as.factor(x)
check_text(x)
```

And if all is well the user should be greeted by a cow:

```{r}
y <- c("A valid sentence.", "yet another!")
check_text(y)
```


## Row Filtering

It is useful to drop/remove empty rows or unwanted rows (for example the researcher dialogue from a transcript).  The `drop_empty_row` & `drop_row` do empty row do just this.  First I'll demo the removal of empty rows.


```{r}
## create a data set wit empty rows
(dat <- rbind.data.frame(DATA[, c(1, 4)], matrix(rep(" ", 4), 
    ncol =2, dimnames=list(12:13, colnames(DATA)[c(1, 4)]))))

drop_empty_row(dat)
```

Next we drop out rows.  The `drop_row` function takes a data set, a column (named or numeric position) and regex terms to search for.  The `terms` argument takes regex(es) allowing for partial matching.  `terms` is case sensitive  but can be changed via the `ignore.case` argument.

```{r}
drop_row(dataframe = DATA, column = "person", terms = c("sam", "greg"))
drop_row(DATA, 1, c("sam", "greg"))
keep_row(DATA, 1, c("sam", "greg"))
drop_row(DATA, "state", c("Comp"))
drop_row(DATA, "state", c("I "))
drop_row(DATA, "state", c("you"), ignore.case = TRUE)
```

## Stripping

Often it is useful to remove all non relevant symbols and case from a text (letters, spaces, and apostrophes are retained).  The `strip` function accomplishes this.  The `char.keep` argument allows the user to retain characters.


```{r}
strip(DATA$state)
strip(DATA$state, apostrophe.remove = TRUE)
strip(DATA$state, char.keep = c("?", "."))
```


## Subbing

### Multiple Subs

`gsub` is a great tool but often the user wants to replace a vector of elements with another vector.  `mgsub` allows for a vector of patterns and replacements.  Note that the first argument of `mgsub` is the data, not the `pattern` as is standard with base R's `gsub`.  This allows `mgsub` to be used in a **magrittr** pipeline more easily.  Also note that by default `fixed = TRUE`.  This means the search `pattern` is not a regex per-se.  This makes the replacement much faster when a regex search is not needed.  `mgsub` also reorders the patterns to ensure patterns contained within patterns don't over write the longer pattern.  For example if the pattern `c('i', 'it')` is given the longer `'it'` is replaced first (though `order.pattern = FALSE` can be used to negate this feature).

```{r}
mgsub(DATA$state, c("it's", "I'm"), c("<<it is>>", "<<I am>>"))
mgsub(DATA$state, "[[:punct:]]", "<<PUNCT>>", fixed = FALSE)
mgsub(DATA$state, c("i", "it"), c("<<I>>", "[[IT]]"))
mgsub(DATA$state, c("i", "it"), c("<<I>>", "[[IT]]"), order.pattern = FALSE)
```

### Stashing Character Pre-Sub

There are times the user may want to stash a set of characters before subbing out and then return the stashed characters.  An example of this is when a researcher wants to remove punctuation but not emoticons.  The `subholder` function provides tooling to stash the emoticons, allow a punctuation stripping, and then return the emoticons.  First I'll create some fake text data with emoticons, then stash the emoticons (using a unique text key to hold their place), then I'll strip out the punctuation, and last put the stashed emoticons back.


```{r}
(fake_dat <- paste(hash_emoticons[1:11, 1, with=FALSE][[1]], DATA$state))
(m <- sub_holder(fake_dat, hash_emoticons[[1]]))
(m_stripped <-strip(m$output))
m$unhold(m_stripped)
```


## Replacement

**textclean** contains tools to replace substrings within text with other substrings that may be easier to analyze.  This section outlines the uses of these tools.  

### Contractions

Some analysis techniques require contractions to be replaced with their multi-word forms (e.g., "I'll" -> "I will").  `replace_contrction` provides this functionality.

```{r}
x <- c("Mr. Jones isn't going.",  
    "Check it out what's going on.",
    "He's here but didn't go.",
    "the robot at t.s. wasn't nice", 
    "he'd like it if i'd go away")

replace_contraction(x)
```

### Emoticons

Some analysis techniques examine words, meaning emoticons may be ignored.  `replace_emoticons` replaces emoticons with their word forms equivalents.

```{r}
x <- c(
    "text from: http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/textmessageabbreviations_02.asp",
    "... understanding what different characters used in smiley faces mean:",
    "The close bracket represents a sideways smile  )",
    "Add in the colon and you have sideways eyes   :",
    "Put them together to make a smiley face  :)",
    "Use the dash -  to add a nose   :-)",
    "Change the colon to a semi-colon ; and you have a winking face ;)  with a nose  ;-)",
    "Put a zero 0 (halo) on top and now you have a winking, smiling angel 0;) with a nose 0;-)",
    "Use the letter 8 in place of the colon for sunglasses 8-)",
    "Use the open bracket ( to turn the smile into a frown  :-("
)

replace_emoticon(x)
```

### Grades

In analysis where grades may be discussed it may be useful to convert the letter forms into word meanings.  The `replace_grade` can be used for this task.

```{r}
text <- c(
    "I give an A+",
    "He deserves an F",
    "It's C+ work",
    "A poor example deserves a C!"
)
replace_grade(text)
```

### HTML

Sometimes HTML tags and symbols stick around like pesky gnats.  The `replace_html` function makes light work of them.

```{r}
x <- c(
    "<bold>Random</bold> text with symbols: &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &amp; &quot; &apos;",
    "<p>More text</p> &cent; &pound; &yen; &euro; &copy; &reg;"
)

replace_html(x)
```

### Incomplete Sentences

Sometimes an incomplete sentence is denoted with multiple end marks or no punctuation at all.  `replace_incomplete` standardizes these sentences with a pipe (`|`) endmark (or one of the user's choice).

```{r}
x <- c("the...",  "I.?", "you.", "threw..", "we?")
replace_incomplete(x)
replace_incomplete(x, '...')
```

### Names

Often one will want to standardize text by removing first and last names.  The `replace_names` function quickly removes/replaces common first and last names.  This can be made more targeted by feeding a vector of names extractracted via a named entity extractor.

```{r}
x <- c(
    "Mary Smith is not here",
     "Karen is not a nice person",
     "Will will do it",
    NA
)
 
replace_names(x)
replace_names(x, replacement = '<<NAME>>')
```
### Non-ASCII Characters

R can choke on non-ASCII characters.  They can be re-encoded but the new encoding may lack interpretability (e.g., &cent; may be converted to `\xA2` which is not easily understood or likely to be matched in a hash look up).  `replace_non_ascii` attempts to replace common non-ASCII characters with a text representation (e.g., &cent; becomes "cent")  Non recognized non-ASCII characters are simply removed (unless `remove.nonconverted = FALSE`).


```{r}
x <- c(
    "Hello World", "6 Ekstr\xf8m", "J\xf6reskog", "bi\xdfchen Z\xfcrcher",
    'This is a \xA9 but not a \xAE', '6 \xF7 2 = 3', 'fractions \xBC, \xBD, \xBE',
    'cows go \xB5', '30\xA2'
)
Encoding(x) <- "latin1"
x

replace_non_ascii(x)
replace_non_ascii(x, remove.nonconverted = FALSE)
```

### Numbers

Some analysis requires numbers to be converted to text form.  `replace_number` attempts to perform this task.  `replace_number` handles comma separated numbers as well.

```{r}
x <- c("I like 346,457 ice cream cones.", "They are 99 percent good")
y <- c("I like 346457 ice cream cones.", "They are 99 percent good")
replace_number(x)
replace_number(y)
replace_number(x, num.paste = TRUE)
replace_number(x, remove=TRUE)
```

### Ratings

Some texts use ratings to convey satisfaction with a particular object.  The `replace_rating` function replaces the more abstract rating with word equivalents.

```{r}
x <- c("This place receives 5 stars for their APPETIZERS!!!",
     "Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe!",
     "10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.",
     "* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!",
     "For service, I give them no stars.", "This place deserves no stars.",
     "10 out of 10 stars.",
     "My rating: just 3 out of 10.",
     "If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.",
     "Rating: 1 out of 10.",
     "I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.",
     "If it were possible to give them 0/10, they'd have it."
)

replace_rating(x)
```


### Ordinal Numbers

Again, some analysis requires numbers, including ordinal numbers, to be converted to text form.  `replace_ordinal` attempts to perform this task for ordinal number 1-100 (i.e., 1st - 100th).  


```{r}
x <- c(
    "I like the 1st one not the 22nd one.", 
    "For the 100th time stop those 3 things!",
    "I like the 3rd 1 not the 12th 1."
)
replace_ordinal(x)
replace_ordinal(x, TRUE)
replace_ordinal(x, remove = TRUE)
replace_number(replace_ordinal(x))
```


### Symbols

Text often contains short-hand representations of words/phrases.  These symbols may contain analyzable information but in the symbolic form they cannot be parsed.  The `replace_symbol` function attempts to replace the symbols `c("$", "%", "#", "@", "& "w/")` with their word equivalents.

```{r}
x <- c("I am @ Jon's & Jim's w/ Marry", 
    "I owe $41 for food", 
    "two is 10% of a #"
)
replace_symbol(x)
```

### White Space

Regex white space characters (e.g., `\n`, `\t`, `\r`) matched by `\s` may impede analysis.  These can be replaced with a single space `" "` via the `replace_white` function.

```{r}
x <- "I go \r
    to   the \tnext line"
x
cat(x)
replace_white(x)
```


### Tokens

Often an analysis requires converting tokens of a certain type into a common form or removing them entirely.  The `mgsub` function can do this task, however it is regex based and time consuming when the number of tokens to replace is large.  For example, one may want to replace all proper nouns that are first names with the word name.  The `replace_token` provides a fast way to replace a group of tokens with a single replacement.

This example shows a use case for `replace_token`:

```{r}
## Set Up the Tokens to Replace
nms <- gsub("(^.)(.*)", "\\U\\1\\L\\2", lexicon::common_names, perl = TRUE)
head(nms)

## Set Up the Data
x <- textshape::split_portion(sample(c(sample(lexicon::grady_augmented, 20000), 
    sample(nms, 10000, TRUE))), n.words = 12)
x$text.var <- paste0(x$text.var, sample(c('.', '!', '?'), length(x$text.var), TRUE))
head(x$text.var)

head(replace_tokens(x$text.var, nms, 'NAME'))
```



This demonstration shows how fast token replacement can be with `replace_token`:

```{r}
## mgsub
tic <- Sys.time()
head(mgsub(x$text.var, nms, "NAME"))
(toc <- Sys.time() - tic)

## replace_tokens
tic <- Sys.time()
head(replace_tokens(x$text.var, nms, "NAME"))
(toc <- Sys.time() - tic)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tic <- Sys.time()
out <- replace_tokens(rep(x$text.var, 20), nms, "NAME")
toc <- Sys.time() - tic
```

Now let's amp it up with 20x more text data.  That's `r f_comma(length(x$text.var) * 20)` rows of text (`r f_comma(sum(stringi::stri_count_words(x$text.var))*20)` words) and `r f_comma(length(nms))` replacement tokens in `r round(toc, 1)` seconds.

```
tic <- Sys.time()
out <- replace_tokens(rep(x$text.var, 20), nms, "NAME")
(toc <- Sys.time() - tic)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
toc
```
