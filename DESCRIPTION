Description: Tools to clean and process text.  Tools are geared at checking for substrings
          that are not optimal for analysis and replacing or removing them with more analysis
          friendly substrings. For example, emoticons are often used in text but not always
          easily handled by analysis algorithms.  The 'replace_emoticon()' function replaces
          emoticons with word equivalents.
